        <h1>Write Viral Dog Content. Work Remotely. Get Paid for Quality.</h1>
        <p>We're hiring content writers who can turn breed-specific dog topics into scroll-stopping vertical video scripts—using real research from dog owner communities.</p>

    <main class="container">

        <!-- SECTION 2: ABOUT THE ROLE -->
        <section id="about">
            <h2>What You'll Actually Do</h2>
            <p>As a technical content writer on our team, you'll create 50-second vertical video scripts (like TikTok/Instagram Reels) focused on specific dog breeds.</p>
            <h3>Your Process:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Research:</strong> 🔍 Dive into Reddit threads, Facebook groups, and breed-specific forums to find what dog owners are actually saying.</li>
                <li><strong>Extract:</strong> Pull authentic quotes (UGC - User Generated Content) that reveal pain points, questions, and emotions.</li>
                <li><strong>Write:</strong> ✏️ Craft conversational scripts that weave these real owner voices into educational, engaging content.</li>
                <li><strong>Simplify:</strong> Turn complex topics (health issues, behavior problems, training challenges) into relatable analogies.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Example Topics:</h3>
            <div class="example-topic">"Why Your French Bulldog Breathes Like That (And When It's Dangerous)"</div>
            <div class="example-topic">"The Real Reason Your Shiba Inu Ignores You"</div>

            <h3>Script Structure You'll Follow:</h3>
            <ul class="list-style-none">
                <li><strong>Hook (0-2 seconds):</strong> Stop the scroll</li>
                <li><strong>Problem Setup (2-8 seconds):</strong> Present the issue</li>
                <li><strong>Revelations with UGC (8-40 seconds):</strong> Educate using real dog owner quotes</li>
                <li><strong>CTA (40-50 seconds):</strong> Drive engagement</li>
            </ul>

                <li>✅ You're a dog owner or deeply familiar with online dog communities</li>
                <li>✅ You can write like you talk—conversational, natural, zero corporate speak</li>
                <li>✅ You love research and can spend 30 minutes digging through Reddit threads to find gold</li>
                <li>✅ You understand how to make complex ideas simple (without dumbing them down)</li>
                <li>✅ You're comfortable using AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude) to assist your workflow</li>
                <li>✅ You follow instructions precisely and meet deadlines</li>
                <li>✅ You want feedback and are willing to revise your work</li>

                <li>❌ You think "professional writing" means formal, academic tone</li>
                <li>❌ <strong>You just want to pump out AI-generated content without real research</strong></li>
                <li>❌ You can't handle constructive feedback</li>
